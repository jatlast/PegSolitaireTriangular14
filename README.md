  Homework 2
  2.0 Programming:
      ii) For graduate students find a puzzle (the puzzle below is a fun
          one) or other problem of interest and code it up. Use either the
          BFS or the DFS to do this.
              a) Extra Credit (5 points) â€“ Also write a breadth-first search
                  or explain thru complexity analysis of space and
                  memory requirements due to depth and branching factor
                  why it would not work on that problem.
